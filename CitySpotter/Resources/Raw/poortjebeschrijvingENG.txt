 Het Poortje in the Karrestraat in Breda is a historic entrance gate known for its richly decorated architecture. This sandstone gate, built around 1615, is located near Karrestraat 7 and was originally the rear exit of the old Vleeshal, a building that served for the sale of meat. The Vleeshal is now in use as the Municipal and Episcopal Museum.

The gate is notable for its detailed ornamentation, including a carved frame and ornate elements that reflect the style of the early 17th century. It is one of the few remaining examples of Renaissance architecture in Breda and is therefore a valuable piece of heritage.

Today, the Poortje in the Karrestraat is a protected national monument and a popular stop for visitors exploring the historic city center of Breda. It is a silent witness to the rich history of the city and an example of the attention to detail in the architecture of that time.
