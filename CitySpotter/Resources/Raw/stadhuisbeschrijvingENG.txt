 Breda Town Hall is a historic building on the Grote Markt and one of the city's most iconic landmarks. The original town hall was built in the 14th century, but after a major fire in 1534 it was rebuilt and further expanded and adapted over the centuries.

The current town hall is a fine example of classical architecture and has an imposing, symmetrical facade dating from the 18th century. The facade unites three former buildings into one harmonious whole. Inside are beautiful historic halls, including the wedding hall and the council chamber, which are richly decorated with paintings, chandeliers and historical ornaments.

The town hall is still used for official occasions, such as weddings and city council meetings. For visitors, the building offers a glimpse of the rich history and administrative heritage of Breda. During special events and open days, the public can admire the atmospheric interiors and learn more about the role of the town hall over the centuries.
