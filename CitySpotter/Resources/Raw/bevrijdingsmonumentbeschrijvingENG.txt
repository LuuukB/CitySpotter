 The Liberation Monument in Breda is an impressive tribute to the liberation of the city during the Second World War. The monument, located in Valkenberg Park, commemorates the Polish soldiers of the 1st Armored Division led by General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek, who liberated Breda on October 29, 1944.

The monument consists of a large plaque with a map of Europe and the route that Polish troops followed to liberate Breda and other parts of Europe. In addition, there is an inscription with an expression of gratitude to the Polish liberators and a reminder of their courage and sacrifice.

The Liberation Monument is not only a symbol of gratitude, but also a place of reflection. Every year, flowers are laid here during commemorations and ceremonies are held to commemorate the liberation of Breda and the sacrifices made for it. For visitors, the monument offers a moment of reflection and an opportunity to reflect on the history of the city and the role Breda played in the liberation of Europe.
