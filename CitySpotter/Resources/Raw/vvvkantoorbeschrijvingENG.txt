The former tourist office in Breda was located on Willemstraat, near the central station. In 2020, the tourist office closed its doors permanently due to a decline in visitor numbers and changing consumer behavior, with more and more people looking for information online.

After the closure, the building was taken over by CoffeeLab, a catering facility that focuses on coffee, lunches and flexible workplaces. To serve both tourists and residents of Breda, a 'shop-in-shop' concept was introduced in collaboration with InBreda. Here visitors can find information about the city, city tours, boat trips and Breda souvenirs.

The building itself has a modern look and is strategically located for tourists and locals alike. With the transformation into CoffeeLab and the addition of tourist information, the building continues to play an important role in welcoming and informing visitors to Breda.
