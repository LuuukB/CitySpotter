The Stadhouderspoort is a historic gateway to Breda Castle, located in the center of the city. This gate, accessible via a footbridge over the moat, is located behind the Crane Gate and provides pedestrian access to the castle complex.

The gate has a triangular pediment and bears the coat of arms of Stadtholder William V, surrounded by the motto of the Order of the Garter: "Honi soit qui mal y pense" ("Shame on him who thinks evil of it"). The south side of the gate was restored in 1959.

Historically, the Stadhouderspoort is the third original entrance to the castle complex. Foundations of two predecessors, built by the Van Polanen and Jan IV van Nassau families, have been found in the fortress moat. The gate runs diagonally through the so-called "Thick Wall", a ten-meter thick wall that was part of the defense works. Above this wall was the Egmond Gallery, an open gallery that also served as a weather wall.

Today, the Stadhouderspoort is an important historical monument and is part of the Royal Military Academy (KMA), which has been located in the castle since 1828. Visitors can admire the gate during guided tours of the castle and surrounding grounds.
