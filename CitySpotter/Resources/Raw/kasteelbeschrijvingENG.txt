 Breda Castle is one of the city's most iconic and historic locations. Located on Kasteelplein, in the middle of Breda, this impressive building has a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages. Over the centuries, the castle has been closely linked to the noble Nassau family, which earned Breda the nickname "Nassaustad".

Originally built as a medieval fortress, the castle was transformed into a luxurious Renaissance palace by Henry III of Nassau in the 16th century. The design and expansion of the castle are partly due to the famous architect Thomas Vincidor, a student of Raphael. The impressive Spaniard's Gate, one of the entrance gates, is a reminder of the Spanish occupation during the Eighty Years' War.

Today, Breda Castle is used by the Royal Military Academy (KMA) and is therefore not freely accessible to the public. Nevertheless, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the castle's beautiful interior and rich history during special occasions or guided tours.

The surroundings of the castle, such as Kasteelplein and the adjacent Valkenberg Park, offer beautiful views of the structure and are a popular place for a relaxing walk. Breda Castle is not only a historical monument, but also an important symbol of the city and its royal and military heritage.
