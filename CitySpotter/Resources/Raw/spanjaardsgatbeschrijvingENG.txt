 The Spanjaardsgat is a historic water gate in Breda, located between the Duiventoren and the Granaattoren on the southwestern side of Breda Castle. Although the name suggests that it played a role during the capture of Breda by the Turfschip in 1590, the Spanjaardsgat was not built until around 1610, about twenty years after this event.

The name "Spanjaardsgat" refers to the ruse with the Peat Ship of Breda, in which troops of Prince Maurits, hidden in the hold of a peat ship, managed to recapture Breda, occupied by the Spanish. Although the Spanjaardsgat itself did not play a direct role in this event, for many it symbolizes the entrance to the castle grounds where this historic event took place.

Nowadays the Spanjaardsgat and its associated towers are used by the Royal Military Academy (KMA). The Spanjaardsgat and the nearby Hoge Brug are iconic sights in Breda and attract many visitors every year who are interested in the city's rich history.
