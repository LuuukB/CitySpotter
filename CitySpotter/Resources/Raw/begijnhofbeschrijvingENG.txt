The Begijnhof in Breda is one of the most enchanting and historic places in the city. Hidden behind the hustle and bustle of the city center, on Catharinastraat, this special place offers a serene and timeless atmosphere that transports visitors back to a bygone era.

The Begijnhof was originally founded in the 13th century and for centuries was home to beguines, pious women who lived in community without taking formal monastic vows. The current Beguinage, built in the 16th and 17th centuries, consists of a series of characteristic houses surrounding an idyllic courtyard. This garden, with its herbs, flowers and old trees, was once of great importance to the Beguines and is still carefully maintained.

There are two chapels in the heart of the Begijnhof: the H. Catherine Chapel, an intimate prayer room, and the H. Anna Chapel, an attractive location for gatherings. Both exude an atmosphere of peace and devotion. The Begijnhof also has a small museum, where visitors can learn more about the daily life and history of the Beguines.

The Begijnhof in Breda is not only a historical monument, but also a place of reflection and beauty. For visitors to the city, it is a unique opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle and discover Breda's rich history and quiet charm.
