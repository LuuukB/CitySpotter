The Nassau Baroniemonument, also known as the Baroniemonument, is located in the Valkenbergpark in Breda, near the Willemsbrug. This monument was erected in 1905 to commemorate the 500-year bond between Breda and the House of Orange-Nassau. In 1404, Engelbrecht I of Nassau-Siegen was installed as lord of Breda, marking the beginning of this long-lasting relationship. 
The monument shows three reliefs depicting the inauguration of Engelbrecht and his wife, 11-year-old Johanna van Polanen from Breda, as lord and lady of Breda. Their marriage laid the foundation for the House of Orange-Nassau, the current Dutch royal house.
The Nassau Baroniemonument is an important historical landmark in Breda and is part of various city walks and cultural routes. Visitors can admire the monument while walking through the picturesque Valkenberg Park, which is located a short distance from the central station and the city center.
