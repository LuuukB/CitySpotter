 The Vismarkt in Breda is a historic square located on the harbour, near the Vismarktstraat. Originally, the fish market was held in the narrow Vismarktstraat, but after the city fire of 1490, the city council decided to move the market to a more spacious square at the Harbor, which was constructed from 1492. This created the New Vismarkt, while the old location became known as Vismarktstraat.

An open fishing hall was built on the Fish Market, with a slate roof supported by bluestone columns in Doric style. This hall served for the sale of sea fish, while river fish was traded in a separate hall. The construction of the sea fishing hall took place between 1744 and 1823. Between 1880 and 1905 the fishing hall underwent several renovations, including the removal of the intermediate columns to create an open space and the installation of fencing. In 1966, the building was designated a national monument and restored shortly afterwards, with a focus on replacing natural stone. A second restoration followed in 2007.

The Vismarkt and its associated fishing hall are important historical locations in Breda and bear witness to the city's rich trading history. Today, the former fishing hall houses catering establishments and the square forms a lively part of the city center, where visitors can enjoy the historic ambiance and the proximity of the harbour.
