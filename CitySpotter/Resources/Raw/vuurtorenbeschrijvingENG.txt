Although Breda is far from the coast, the city has a special "lighthouse" known as a playful work of art and striking landmark. This lighthouse, located in the Belcrum district, is not a traditional lighthouse that shows ships the way, but a creative and symbolic structure that refers to the connection between Breda and water.

The lighthouse is located in Speelhuislaan, near the old harbor of Breda, and is a striking object that reflects the transformation of the Belcrum district. Where the district used to have an industrial appearance, it is now a creative and cultural hotspot. The lighthouse is a playful addition that recalls the maritime influences in the city, such as the role of the Mark and the port in the past.

With its cheerful and colorful appearance, the lighthouse is a popular place for photos and a recognizable symbol for Breda's creative vibe. For visitors, it is a surprising and unique element that shows how Breda knows how to honor its historical and industrial roots in an innovative way.
