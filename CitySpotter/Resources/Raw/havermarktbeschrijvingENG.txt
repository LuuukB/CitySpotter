The Havermarkt is a lively square in the heart of Breda, located near the Grote Kerk and the Harbour. The square is surrounded by various cafés and restaurants, making it a popular destination for both locals and visitors who want to enjoy Breda hospitality.

Historically, the Havermarkt has undergone a transformation. Around 1960 the square started to develop into the entertainment center of Breda, partly due to the increasing prosperity and leisure time of the population. The aim was to make the Havermarkt resemble the Parisian Place du Tertre, which resulted in restorations of historic buildings and the opening of new catering establishments.

Nowadays, the Havermarkt is known for its vibrant nightlife and diverse culinary offering. Well-known establishments such as Café Corenmaet, Suikerkist, Café Bruxelles and Feestcafé Peddels offer a mix of warm atmosphere, urban street food, spacious terraces and festive evenings. The Havermarkt remains a central point in Breda's nightlife, where historic charm and modern coziness come together.
