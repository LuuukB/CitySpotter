 The Grote Markt is the historic and lively heart of Breda. Originally known as the "Plaetse", the square served as a central meeting place for the city. Annual markets were already held here in 1313, such as the Sinxenmarkt and the Barnismarkt. The square also served as a location for public executions by the city government.

There are several historic buildings on the Grote Markt, including Breda's old town hall. The original town hall was built in the 13th century, but rebuilt after a fire in 1534. The current facade dates from the 18th century and unites three former houses into one whole.

Today, the Grote Markt is a bustling square with numerous restaurants, cafés and shops. It is a popular location for events such as carnival, the Breda Jazz Festival and the Singelloop.

Visitors can enjoy the view of the Grote Kerk, an impressive Gothic structure that dominates the square. The combination of historic architecture and modern amenities makes the Grote Markt a must-see for anyone visiting Breda.
