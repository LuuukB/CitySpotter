 The Kloosterkazerne in Breda is a special building with a rich history, located on the Seeligsingel. The building combines religious and military heritage and is an impressive example of how Breda has managed to preserve its historic architecture and give it a new function.

Originally a monastery built in the 19th century by the Sisters of Charity. The religious community played an important role in education and healthcare in Breda. Later, around the beginning of the 20th century, the building was converted into a barracks and given the name Kloosterkazerne. It served as a shelter for soldiers for decades and was an important part of the city's military infrastructure.

The architecture of the Monastery Barracks reflects its original monastic function with simple but elegant brick constructions and symmetrical designs. The building has an imposing appearance and is located in a green environment, which makes it a unique place in Breda.

Today, the building has been given a new purpose and is used for various social and cultural purposes. The Monastery Barracks is a good example of how historical heritage can be given a new life, while retaining the memory of its rich past. For visitors to Breda, the Kloosterkazerne offers an opportunity to discover both the religious and military heritage of the city.
