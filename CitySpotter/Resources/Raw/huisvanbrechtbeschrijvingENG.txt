 The House of Brecht is one of the oldest court houses in Breda, located on the Cingelstraat on the grounds of Breda Castle. It was built in Gothic style at the beginning of the fourteenth century and has undergone several modifications since then. The house takes its name from the Van Brecht family, who lived there from 1427. Govaert van Brecht, who also owned Bouvigne Castle, bought the house around 1530 and expanded it with a gallery in the courtyard.

It is remarkable that the House of Brecht is one of the few important stone buildings that survived the great city fires of 1490 and 1534. Today it houses the library of the Royal Military Academy (KMA), which has been located in the castle since 1828.

The house is an important example of Breda's rich history and architecture and is part of the city's cultural heritage. Visitors can admire it on guided tours of the KMA grounds, although access to the interior is limited due to its use as an academic library
